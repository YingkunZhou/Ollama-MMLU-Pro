# MMLU-Pro & MMMLU

Here we mainly use there dataset:
- IGER-Lab/MMLU-Pro only `--category` 'computer science' (run_openai.py)
- sam-paech/mmlu-pro-nomath-sml (run_openai.py)
- openai/MMMLU  `--category` ZH_CN/PT_BR/FR_FR/ES_LA/DE_DE (run_openai-mmmlu.py)

```bash
python dataset.py
```

This is a modified version of run_gpt4o.py from [TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro](https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro), and it lets you run [MMLU-Pro](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MMLU-Pro) benchmark via the OpenAI Chat Completion API. It's tested on Ollama and Llama.cpp, but it should also work with LMStudio, Koboldcpp, Oobabooga with openai extension, etc.

I kept the  testing and scoring  method exactly the same as the original script, adding only a few features to simplify running the test and displaying the results. To see    the exact changes, compare between mmlu-pro branch against main with git diff:

```bash
git diff mmlu-pro..main -- run_openai.py
```

## Usage

Change the config.toml according to your setup.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_openai.py
```

You can also override   settings in configuration file    with  command line flags like --model, ----category, etc. For example, if you   specify `--model phi3`, all the settings  from configuration file will be loaded except model. See `python run_openai.py -h` for more info.

## Additional Notes

* If an answer cannot be extracted from the model's response, the script will randomly assign an answer. It's the same way as the original script.
* The total score represents the number of correct answers out of the total number of attempts including random guess attempts. This is the score from the original script.
* "Random Guess Attempts" indicates the total number of random guesses out of the total attempts.
* "Correct Random Guesses" shows the number of random guesses that were correct out of all the random guesses.
* "Adjusted Score Without Random Guesses" subtracts all random guesses from the correct answers and the total answers.
* The last overall   score in the table  is calculated as: the total number of correct answers across all categories / the total number of all attempts across all categories * 100.
* All the   scores in percentage are rounded numbers.
